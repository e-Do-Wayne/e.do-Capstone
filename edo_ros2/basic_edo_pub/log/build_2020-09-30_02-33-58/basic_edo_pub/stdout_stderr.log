CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findedo_core_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "edo_core_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "edo_core_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    edo_core_msgsConfig.cmake
    edo_core_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "edo_core_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "edo_core_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "edo_core_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
